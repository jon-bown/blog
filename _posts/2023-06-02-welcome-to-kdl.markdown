Hello there! I'm Jonathan Bown, an MLOps Engineer working to bring A.I. to higher education. My foundation in mathematical statistics and computer science enables me to dive deep into complex problems and emerge with clear, innovative solutions.

Welcome to my blog, 'Keep Deep Learning'. This space serves several purposes:

1. **Accountability** - This blog acts as a self-motivational tool, encouraging me to continually push boundaries and stay up-to-date in my field.
2. **Organization** - It provides a structured platform for me to systematically explore and document my journey through the fascinating world of mathematics, computer science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
3. **Accessibility** - While I've previously engaged in vibrant discussions on Kaggle forums, this blog offers a more comprehensive and easily accessible repository of my thoughts, learnings, and findings.

Consider 'Keep Deep Learning' as a digital journal where I chronicle captivating insights, challenging obstacles, and innovative breakthroughs that I encounter while expanding my knowledge and growing my career. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast in the field or someone just starting to dip their toes into the world of AI and ML, there's something here for you. So, come join me on this exciting journey, and let's 'Keep Deep Learning' together!
