Ever wanted to interact with your pandas data frame using natural language instead of specific syntax? You're not alone! Storytelling with data could be vastly streamlined if we could just converse with our notebook, providing context as needed. Now, that's possible with PandasAI.

PandasAI utilizes the OpenAI API, offering an interface for posing questions in natural language and receiving answers in the form of a pandas data frame.

# Usage Instructions

## 1. Installation

To install the library, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install pandasai
```

## 2. Obtain an OpenAI API Key

To use this library, you'll need an OpenAI API key.


## 3. Instantiation

Instantiate the OpenAI class with your API key:

```python
from pandasai.llm.openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(api_token=your_API_key)
```

PandasAI also gives you tools for setting the API key via environment variables or secrets so that you aren't directly inputing your api credential into raw code. 

## 4. Model Initialization

```python
from pandasai import PandasAI

pandas_ai = PandasAI(llm)
```

## 5. Development

The following example, borrowed from the README, demonstrates usage:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandasai import PandasAI

# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "country": ["United States", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "Canada", "Australia", "Japan", "China"],
    "gdp": [19294482071552, 2891615567872, 2411255037952, 3435817336832, 1745433788416, 1181205135360, 1607402389504, 1490967855104, 4380756541440, 14631844184064],
    "happiness_index": [6.94, 7.16, 6.66, 7.07, 6.38, 6.4, 7.23, 7.22, 5.87, 5.12]
})

# Instantiate a LLM
from pandasai.llm.openai import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(api_token=your_API_key)

pandas_ai = PandasAI(llm)
result = pandas_ai.run(df, prompt='Which are the 5 happiest countries?')
result
```

```python
6            Canada
7         Australia
1    United Kingdom
3           Germany
0     United States
Name: country, dtype: object
```

# Visualization Example

```python
pandas_ai.run(
    df,
    "Plot the histogram of countries showing for each the gpd, using different colors for each bar",
)
```

The output of this prompt is the following matplotlib visual:
